## MathJax Support

Added by using the `use_math` tag.

For now defaulted it to every post, page. Will revert in the future in case the pages slow down.

References for the Syntax:

* And Ofcourse this: http://www.gastonsanchez.com/visually-enforced/opinion/2014/02/16/Mathjax-with-jekyll/

We'll stick to kramdown render (for markdown), since it plays fairly nice with both Jekyll 3.x and MathJax.
